<h1>d02 : DeathNote</h1>
Death Note Is a manga in which Light Yagami is the owner of a notebook of death. The person whose name is written in this book dies inevitably.
Today you will learn how to create a very simple Death Note simulation application. You will need to be able to display the name, date and description of the death of everybody in it and you will need to be able to add someone.
This day will allow you to understand how the table views, that are used extensively in iOS applications, works. It is a way of presenting similar data.
This day will also teach you how to change the view on an application and how to go back to an old view.

<h1>d04 : Tweets</h1>

Today you will learn to do HTTP requests to the Twitters‚Äôs API on iOS with the goal of creating a client application for Twitter. It will have to display tweets in a table view.

<h1>d05 : Kanto</h1>

Geolocation is an indispensable weapon of the good iOS developer kit, it is essential to know how to use it.
Apple makes available to you different frameworks like MapKit which allows you to use a very simple map or CoreLocation which allows you to manage the user‚Äôs location.
These 2 frameworks will be your best friends for this day.
You will create a geolocation application of several places using:
a TabBarController : to organise your different views.
a MKMapView : for the map.
a CLLocationManager : to geolocate the user.
a SegmentedControlBar : to change the style of the map. a MKAnnotationView : to customize the pop-up map.

<h1>d06 : MotionCube</h1>

Have you ever heard ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt put your fingers on the screen!‚Äù? Of course today this sentence will have no sense. The disappearence of keyboard in favour of touch screens allows application to expend their interface to not be limited by keyboard keys anymore. As a matter of fact, when you used to play snake on a nokia 3310, we just need 4 keys to direct the snake, everything else is useless.
Apple also equiped their devices with different sensors such as an accelerometer, a gyroscope, proximity sensor or a barometer.
Therefore it is possible to retrieve user input or environment data thanks to the screen and the device‚Äôs sensors.
Today you will learn hos to use the UIGestureRecognizer, to retrieve user‚Äôs acctions on the screem as well as CoreMotion to get the orientation of the device in an application that will allow you to play with small squares and small circles. This shapes will be subject to the laws of physics like gravity, elasticity and collision using aUIDynamicAnimator.
